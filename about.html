                A paragraph is a self-contained unit of writing that focuses on a single main idea or topic, organized into a group of related sentences. Key characteristics of a well-structured paragraph include a topic sentence that states the main idea, supporting sentences that develop and provide evidence for the topic, and a concluding sentence that summarizes or transitions to the next idea.
